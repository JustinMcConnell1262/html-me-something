<h2>Formula 1</h2>

<p>Though I can't say the same for most of my family, somewhere along the lines I picked up a fascination
    for Formula 1 racing. My favorite racer Lewis Hamilton along with Charles Leclerc. Nobody drives as daring
    and achieves results like Hamilton. Leclerc is the most talented Monegasque racer to compete in Formula for years.
    I hope that his success continues to rise and that one day he stands at the top of the podium at the Monaco GP.
